# Matrix Visualization
During a flight from Arizona to New York where the video monitors were broken, I made this Python program to help me understand Dynamic Programming better. The DP example I used is a leetcode question which asks to solve the longest common subsequence between two seperate strings. My program prints out a before and after image of the matrix used to solve this problem. 

Feel free to download the code and try it out.
